# Geometric Omics

Toolkit for omics network analysis and modeling.

## Vision 
- **Network-centric Approach:** Our conviction lies in the transformative power of network analysis methodologies to unlock new insights in omics data.
- **Inspired by [Fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/):** Our goal is to make Geometric Omics an intuitive and accessible platform for all, leveraging the capabilities of open-source projects like [PyTorch Geometric](https://pyg.org/), [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/), and more.
- **Simplified Omics Data Integration:** Our focus is to streamline data integration, saving you from the complexity of pre-processing.
- **Broadened Data Format Compatibility:** We're committed to effortlessly expanding our support for diverse omics data formats.
- **Enhanced Interoperability:** We strive for seamless integration with a multitude of bioinformatics tools, enabling more flexible and customized workflows.
- **Adaptable Analysis Pipeline:** With Geometric Omics, you can tailor the analysis pipeline to meet your project's unique needs.
- **Superior Scalability:** We're designing Geometric Omics to efficiently manage any data scale, ensuring optimal performance regardless of data size.
- **Comprehensive Learning Resources:** We pledge to provide extensive tutorials and documentation to help users of all levels effectively understand and utilize our toolkit.
