# Geometric Omics: Geometric Toolkit for Omics Data Analysis and Modeling 

Geometric Omics is intended to be a powerful, flexible toolkit designed for omics data analysis. Leveraging the power of Python, Mojo, and PyTorch, it provides a unique and efficient platform to handle, integrate, and analyze omics data.

##  Vision 
- **Inspired by Fast.ai:** Building upon the formidable foundation set by [fast.ai](https://docs.fast.ai/), we envision Geometric Omics becoming an even more intuitive and user-friendly platform. Harnessing the strengths of open-source geometric data analysis and modeling projects like [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [PyTorch Geometric](https://pyg.org/), [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/), and more, we are working towards an environment where users at every skill level will be able to focus on deep, insightful analysis and innovative modeling, rather than implementation intricacies.
- **Streamlining Omics Data Integration:** We will continue to simplify the integration of a broad spectrum of omics data, enabling you to channel your efforts into analysis rather than pre-processing.
- **Expanding Data Format Compatibility:** Geometric Omics will be enhancing its capacity to work with various popular omics data formats with effortless ease.
- **Enhancing Interoperability with Leading Bioinformatics Tools:** We are moving towards seamless integration with a wide array of bioinformatics tools, creating a more versatile and customized workflow path.
- **Customizable Analysis Pipeline:** Geometric Omics will offer you the flexibility to adapt the analysis pipeline to suit your specific needs, allowing you to choose whether to include or exclude different modules according to your project requirements.
- **Elevating Scalability:** Geometric Omics is being designed to accommodate any scale of data, ensuring optimal performance regardless of data size.
- **Amplifying Learning Resources:** We are set to provide even more extensive tutorials and documentation to ensure you understand and utilize our toolkit effectively, regardless of your level of expertise.
